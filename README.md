### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a coder by day, dancer by night. I've been doing various forms of swing dance for the past twenty years - that's how I met my partner in 2011, and these days we dance in Birmingham, Alabama with our two dogs. I've got a on-and-off hiking habit, and am collecting fancy ways to prepare coffee. 

I've done most every role on a software team, if not by title then by responsibility. I love eliminating toil in software whether it's a user workflow with too many steps or a release process that takes too long to verify.
