# Ben Dill's README 
 
Hi, I’m Ben! I’m a Staff Engineer. 
 
I’ve worked in a lot of different roles across my career - QA, DevOps, Software Developer, on desktop Windows applications, web apps, mobile-optimized sales funnels, and now video platforms. 
 
This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team. Please feel free to contribute to this page by opening a merge request. 
 
This page is based on a framework built by Jeremy Watson, formerly of GitLab, where a lot of my ideas about healthy remote culture come from. 
 
## About Me 

I grew up in Auburn, Alabama and have been in Birmingham, Alabama for seven years. My partner and I recently bought a house in the Liberty Park area and are working on turning it into a home bit by bit. 
- Before March 2020, my main physical activity was swing dance.

- We’re trying to start up the swing dance club in Birmingham again this year. 
- I like understanding how systems (both technological and social) function. 
- This means I ask “why” a lot, when working both technical and social problems. 
- I also like to talk a fair bit about inputs and outcomes, actions and expectations so that everyone better understands what is happening during both meetings and troubleshooting calls. 
- I lean hard into my lack of understanding. I don’t hesitate to ask embarrassing questions that are (or seem to be) known by everyone except for me. 
- I’m working to minimize distractions throughout the day - when I’m interacting with someone I strive to be fully engaged. I fail sometimes. 
- I love to read. If I were a dragon my hoard would be made of books. Many of those books are unread. It’s more of an aspirational practice. 
## Values that are extremely important to me 
### Service:
The work that I do and the things I accomplish are not for me, they are for the people I serve. On a small scale, that is my family and my team. On a larger scale, the whole development and product teams. Our sales associates, customers, everyone that uses our platform. And so on. The things I can do that help those people are my priority and the ultimate way to motivate me. 
### Collaboration:
Along the same vein as service, working and learning with others is the best way to solve difficult problems. Working together with people who have different experiences and knowledge than I do helps me approach problems in ways that I would not otherwise. I try my best to never work in a silo. 
### Meaningful Work:
The work I do ultimately helps people do things better - communicate more clearly - have more clarity about what is happening and how they can succeed. I do my best to eliminate toil, both in my personal work and in the work I do for others. The less I and those I work with have to do “just because” the better. 
### Diversity:
We do better, more socially aware work when there is a diverse set of viewpoints at the table. To that end, I do what I can to build a diverse team where everyone has a voice. 
## Things I’m working on 
### Efficiency:
We’re still at a point where there are many, many more things to do than there are people to do them. I am trying to figure out how to prioritize and best use my attention and effort. My TODO list tends to grow steadily until I cull the list, usually on a monthly cadence. 
### Building mastery:
I came into the team knowing several technologies quite well, but the retail space is new to me. I am still building that feeling of mastery in our domain to help our team’s technical efforts. 
### Understanding seniority and leadership:
As a senior developer, I try to put mindful effort in to how we direct our efforts on a longer horizon than the day-to-day feature work of software development. How we build out our organization, level up teams, and direct our architecture to build a more stable, sustainable, and malleable system.  

## My role on the team 
I’m still in the “storming” stage of the understanding process, so my role (at least in my mind) is still pretty nebulous. 
 
If you’re on my team, I am here to help you get unstuck and solve the problems you’re facing. I try to enable you to ship easily and quickly by automating away the things that cause toil. The end goal is to allow you to work on the hard problems ahead of us instead of the process. 
 
If you’re not on my team, I’m here to help you understand the challenges we face as an organization and how we can help each other overcome them. I am always willing to lend an ear and provide another viewpoint on the problem. 
 
On my team or not, here are the things I’ll do to help: 
- Provide you with context. There are a lot of moving parts to what we do, and some domains are less well known than others, especially in our various silos. I am always willing to share what I know. 
-  Pair with you on problems. Whether that is sitting down to code together, pulling up a whiteboard, or just talking through the issue. You bring the problem and I’ll work with you to overcome it. 
-  Help you directly. Let me know what I can do to unblock or move you forward and I’ll do it. 
## How you can help me  
- Take ownership. Don’t wait for someone to give you permission when you know something needs to be done. 
- Give me explicit asks. I do better when I know your expectations to the tune of “Hey Ben, I need you to wire up the widgets by Friday so I can show it off to the scout troop” rather than “Look at the widget sometime, okay?” One gives me a clear thing I can deliver for you, the other is pretty nebulous. 
- Be mindful of what you do. Take time in your tasks, reviews, and refinements. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. 
## What I assume about you 
- Positive intent. 
- You’re the Directly Responsible Individual. You know what you’re doing, and when you don’t you will let me know. If there’s something I can do to help you do your job better, you will tell me. 
- If we disagree, we are both working our best to solve the problem together and will continue working from a position of trust and collaboration. Once we make a decision we will stick with it, or agree to revisit later if we can’t make a decision in the time allotted. 
## My working style  
- I work hard to delimit work time. I fail on that sometimes, and you may find me communicating after work hours from time to time. I remind people that work ends at 5pm often, and I appreciate being reminded of that when I forget. 
- No overwork. There are times when we need to dedicate more than a normal work week to meet commitments, but those times should be few and far between. Creative workers like developers work best when well-rested and fresh, and working more than normal hours to “get things done faster” is a recipe for burnout. 
- Unless I specifically use a synchronous communication method, I assume all communication is asynchronous. I do not expect immediate responses to chat or email. If I call and you do not answer, I will find someone else who can help. 
- I disable notifications on my phone. I check email only from my computer. You should consider doing the same. 
## Communicating with me 
- I am working to be more direct and assign concrete follow-up tasks during meetings. 
- If you ever feel like my expectations, objectives, or wanted outcomes are unclear please ask me to clarify. 
- I tend to process verbally. If I ask a question that’s already been covered, usually I am trying to integrate that information into my mental model of the problem. 
- I can float off on a tangent during conversation. A “let’s keep this meeting on topic” is a welcome reminder in that case. 
## Communication SLOs 
I check: 
- My phone whenever it rings during business hours - or call back shortly if I miss a call and receive a message 
- Email daily 
- Chat channels I’m subscribed to regularly, on days I am in the office 

If you need me on short notice for something **urgent** and **important**, call me. 
If your information is **important** and **_not urgent_**, email me. Email is TCP - it will reach me, but is slower than either of the other options. 
If neither of those apply, ping me in chat. I treat chat as ephemeral UDP communication - it may reach its recipient, but there is no guarantee.
